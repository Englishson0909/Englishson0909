### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to take one step at a time, 'cause that's all I can do now..
But I will do follow this path not to succeed but to learn! 


ðŸ˜„ I love drama analysis, play, English liteature. 
  I have been teaching English since 2004 in Gandhi school.
  I think I am very lucky to learn English, to be a mother, and to be in Gandhi school.
